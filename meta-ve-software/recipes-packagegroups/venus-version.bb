# Not really machine specific actually, but the nostamp will cause the task to be
# rerun per machine per build in a multiconfig setup instead of only once per build,
# since the signature is changed per machine because of the nostamp (which causes
# trouble, the same tasks are run on the same directory in parallel).
#
# That is not easily solved:
#  - The recipe cannot depend on DATATIME itself, since bitbake will consider the
#    meta-data changing and doesn't like that.
#  - The mechanism to rerun the task is by changing the signature (so dependend
#    tasks rerun as well).
#  - The mechanism to check that tasks don't need to be run per MACHINE is based
#    on checking that their signatures are equal.
#
# So just make it machine specific, despite the task being completely the same.
